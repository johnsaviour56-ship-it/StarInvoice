# StarInvoice

An invoice-based escrow protocol for freelancers, built on [Stellar](https://stellar.org) using [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org) smart contracts.

## Overview

StarInvoice lets freelancers create on-chain invoices and receive payment through a trustless escrow flow. The client funds the invoice, the freelancer marks work as delivered, and funds are released upon approval — no intermediaries needed.

## Status

This project is intentionally minimal. The `create_invoice` function is implemented. All other escrow functions are stubbed with `TODO` comments and open GitHub issues for contributors to pick up.

## Contract Flow

```
create_invoice → fund_invoice → mark_delivered → approve_payment → release_payment
```

| Function          | Status        |
|-------------------|---------------|
| `create_invoice`  | ✅ Implemented |
| `fund_invoice`    | 🚧 TODO        |
| `mark_delivered`  | 🚧 TODO        |
| `approve_payment` | 🚧 TODO        |
| `release_payment` | 🚧 TODO        |
